# Service for performing a merge patch operation against two Hash objects
#
# Given the following two Hashes
# {a: 1, b: 2, c: {a: 1, b: 2}}
# {b: 1, c: {a: 2}}
#
# The result of performing a merge patch will be
# {a: 1, b: 1, c: {a: 2, b: 2}}
#
# This is designed to be used directly against Mongoid models.
# It confirms that the result of performing the merge operation
# is still a valid model by validating the resultant Hash against
# the passed in Schema.
#
# To generate the JSON from the model for performing the merge patch
# it uses the provided presenter to present the model first.
# This is really only because the schema shape for the Stories API models
# are different from the actual shape of the data storage, so if we
# just extracted the attributes out of the mongo model they
# would not pass the Schema validation

  # @param presenter [#call] used to present the model into the same format the schema expects

  # If the presented model still validates after applying the patch

  #

  # @param patch [Hash] the patch to be applied to the model
  # @return [true, false] whether the schema validated the model after the patch was applied
