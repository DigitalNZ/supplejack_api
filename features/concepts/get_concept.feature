Feature: Get Concept

	Background:
		Given a user with a API Key
		And a concept

	Scenario: Show concept without inline context
		When I get a concept
		Then the JSON should be a hash
    And the JSON at "@context" should be "http://www.example.com/schema"
		And the JSON at "name" should be "Colin McCahon"
    And the JSON at "@id" should be "http://www.example.com/concepts/1"

  Scenario: Show concept with inline context
    When I get a concept with inline context
    Then the JSON should be a hash
    And the JSON at "@context" should be:
      """
